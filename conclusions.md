# Conclusion

Kotlin has been developed with a pragmatic approach and incorporates many 
"lession learned" of older languages. There is almost no downside compared
 to java, while being a modern and approachable language.
 
 Kotlin, in a way, is more comparable to languages like [typescript](http://typescript.org/) 
or maybe even [c#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/).

Innovation is taking place at a breathtaking pace, while still managing to be simple 
enough to be the "first language" to learn.
