# Integration with Java

Kotlin integrates very well with Java:

* Within IntelliJ, you can choose to convert one Java class after the other
 (doesn't work too well, although)
* The only requirement to have Kotlin ready is a 1.8 JVM
* Integration with Maven is seamless


# Integration with JavaScript

Javascript is a first class [runtime](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/javascript/kotlin-to-javascript/kotlin-to-javascript.html) for Kotlin
